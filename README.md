# Data Structures and Algorithms From Scratch

A complete hands-on exploration of Data Structures and Algorithms using Python, starting from fundamental programming concepts and complexity analysis and progressing toward advanced data structures, algorithms, optimization techniques, and algorithm engineering.

This repository is focused on understanding how algorithms actually work.

I will implement important data structures and algorithms from scratch, study their internal behavior, analyze time and space complexity, compare different approaches, benchmark implementations, and understand where each technique is useful.

The goal is to build a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and develop the ability to reason about performance, scalability, memory usage, and computational tradeoffs.

# Why Data Structures and Algorithms?

Software systems constantly need to store, access, search, transform, organize, and process data.

The choice of data structure and algorithm can directly affect:

```text
Performance
Memory Usage
Latency
Throughput
Scalability
Implementation Complexity
```

For example, a problem that requires:

```text
O(n²)
```

with one approach may be reduced to:

```text
O(n log n)
```

or:

```text
O(n)
```

with a different data structure or algorithm.

This repository focuses on understanding why those differences occur and how to make better algorithmic decisions.

What alternatives exist?

When is one approach better than another?

What happens with large inputs?

Can the implementation be optimized?

What are the practical tradeoffs?

# Final Goal

The purpose of this repository is not to collect isolated implementations.

The goal is to develop a deeper understanding of how data structures organize information and how algorithms transform that information efficiently.

The complete workflow is:

```text
Understand the Problem
        ↓
Understand the Data
        ↓
Choose the Data Structure
        ↓
Choose the Algorithm
        ↓
Implement From Scratch
        ↓
Analyze Complexity
        ↓
Test Correctness
        ↓
Benchmark Performance
        ↓
Identify Bottlenecks
        ↓
Optimize
        ↓
Understand the Tradeoffs
```

This repository represents my complete exploration of Data Structures and Algorithms using Python, progressing from fundamental concepts to advanced data structures, algorithms, optimization techniques, and practical algorithm engineering.
